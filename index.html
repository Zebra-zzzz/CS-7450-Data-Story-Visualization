                    <p class="text">Adventure movies have an average gross of $125884510. Action movies have an average gross of 88840322. It is no wonder they are among the 4 most frequently shooted genres.</p>

                <div class="step" data-step="3">

                    <p class="text">Even though comedy and drama are also among the top 4 frequently shooted genres, their gross is much lower than action and adventure movies.</p>

                <div class="step" data-step="4">
                    <p class="text title">High gross does not mean high return of interest (ROI)</p>
                    <p class="text">It is interesting that even though the gross of comedy and drama is not that high, but their ROI (Comedy: 1.05, Drama: 1.003) is much higher than adventure and action movies (Adventure: 0.31, Action: 0.15). And surprisingly, horror gots the highest average ROI rate of 11.46.</p>

                    <p class="text">While a higher IMDb score cannot guarantee a higer gross, but in generall a movie with a higher score is more likely to have a higher gross.</p>
